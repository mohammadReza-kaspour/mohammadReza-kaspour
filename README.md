- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mohammadReza-kaspour
  
- ðŸ‘€ I am crazy about back-end programming and I am one of the
    lovers of JavaScript language and I am looking for learning new technologies especially in the
    field of back-end and in my opinion it is a good job if you have enough time to improve your
    programming knowledge ;). I am not a strict person in social relations and I prefer to be junior in
    the company of pros :) We will get to know each other even more if we become teammates :)
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about backend....
